# Hotel-Reputation-Enhancement-Through-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Google-Reviews
This project enhances a local hotel's online reputation through text classification and sentiment analysis of Google reviews. Using SerpAPI for web scraping, it performs thematic analysis of low-rated reviews and develops a predictive model to correlate guest expenditures with review sentiments. This was acheived as part of a group project with 4 other individuals.

## Business Problem
The Galmont Hotel is a luxurious 4-Star hotel in the heart of Galway. It is frequented by people from all over the world who visit Galway as it is very close to the train and bus station. For tourists, Google Search is the go-to platform to look at reviews and deciding which hotel to stay at. Therefore, it is imperative to have a good presence on their platform to attract travellers to their hotel. Galmont hotel has a review of 4 stars, which seems good, but the other 4 star hotels have a much better review which has caused a loss of revenue to the hotel. Therefore, they want to know what the guests are talking about them on Google reviews. We are a team of business analysts called The Alpha-Analyzers. Galmont Hotel has hired us to analyse the reviews that are left on Google reviews by the guests, so that they can increase their revenue and elevate the satisfaction that the guests are feeling towards the hotel. Therefore, we have performed the following analysis using the reviews from Google Search.

## Tasks performed

To achieve the objective given to us by Galmont Hotel management team, we have performed the following **Text Classification** tasks:

1. **Web Scraping:** We have used the Serp API to scrape the guest reviews that are present on the Google website.
2. **Graphical Analysis:** There were some reviews which were present in different languages, so we have used these reviews for descriptive analysis.
3. **Thematic Analysis:** After getting the reviews data, we have used the reviews which have a rating of 3 star and lower to perform thematic analysis on the data.
4. **Modelling based on spending patterns:** We have designed a classification model based on the expenditure done by the guests as analysed from the reviews.
