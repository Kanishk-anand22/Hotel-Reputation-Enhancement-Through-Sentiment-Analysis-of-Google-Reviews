    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Galmont Hotel is a luxurious 4-Star hotel in the heart of Galway. It is frequented by people from all over the world who visit Galway as it is very close to the train and bus station. For tourists, Google Search is the go-to platform to look at reviews and deciding which hotel to stay at. Therefore, it is imperative to have a good presence on their platform to attract travellers to their hotel. Galmont hotel has a review of 4 stars, which seems good, but the other 4 star hotels have a much better review which has caused a loss of revenue to the hotel. Therefore, they want to know what the guests are talking about them on Google reviews. We are a team of business analysts called The Alpha-Analyzers. Galmont Hotel has hired us to analyse the reviews that are left on Google reviews by the guests, so that they can increase their revenue and elevate the satisfaction that the guests are feeling towards the hotel. Therefore, we have performed the following analysis using the reviews from Google Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks performed\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the objective given to us by Galmont Hotel management team, we have performed the following **Text Classification** tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Scraping:** We will use the Serp API to scrape the guest reviews that are present on the Google website.\n",
    "2. **Graphical Analysis:** There were some reviews which were present in different languages, so we have used these reviews for descriptive analysis.\n",
    "3. **Thematic Analysis:** After getting the reviews data, we will use the reviews which have a rating of 3 star and lower to perform thematic analysis on the data.\n",
    "4. **Modelling based on spending patterns:** We have designed a classification model based on the expenditure done by the guests as analysed from the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Explanation:** This Python code uses the SerpApi to fetch Google Maps reviews for a specific place, identified by a data_id (Google Maps Place ID). We tried many APIs to fech the reviews of The Galmont hotel but most of the APIs had restrictions(Like Google API, TripAdvisor API) to fetch the reviews, so after extensive research we landed up with SerpAPI. It initializes search parameters with an API key, search engine type for Google Maps reviews, and language preference. The script enters a loop to extract reviews page by page, appending each review's details (such as name, link, thumbnail, rating, date, snippet, images, and Local Guide status) to a reviews list.\n",
    "The loop breaks on encountering an error or when there are no more pages to fetch. Finally, it prints the collected reviews in JSON format. This JSON file is then exported to an external file so that other members from the group can use the file to write their part of the code."

The pool and leisure amenities were great too. The lockers and showers could be improved but not a big deal. The hotel is really close to the bus and train station and the main areas of the city are a short walk away. Overall, Its really good value and perfect for a relaxing getaway.\",\n",

However, the hotel is very large and oddly shaped and there are rooms in a 1200 & 1300 block that are quite hard to find and I got lost multiple times coming from or to these rooms. We also had several rooms where we found the beds were not up to hotel standards.  In the room I was in there were many long black hairs as though after making the bed someone laid down and relaxed. We also had several rooms that we had asked for double occupancy for multiple people to be in the room and we found the rooms to be 2 twin beds pushed together and even made a 1 bed with the sheets in 1 room. This is not that bad as we just moved the beds but we did give a list with the details and it seems going that extra mile would have been the difference.  There was also quite a bit of dust and spider webs in the stairwells.\\nThe food was pretty good and you get plenty. Though our St Patrick's Day Cheesecake everyone had a different thickness in their Graham cavorting crust. And they did not seem to make their portions uniform in the main dishes.  Our first night's dinner the Roasted chicken dishes varied wildly from plate to plate in size.  Sorry no pivots as I didn't know everyone so I don't have the pictures of everyone's food.  But my chicken was the smallest one at the table everyone else was about 15-20% large pieces. I didn't have it but they said the Chocolate Mousse was wonderful!\\nFor vending machines I earn you that the one in the 1200 block of the hotel will only take coins and no credit card or mobile payment.  The one buy the main elevator on the 1st floor had a mobile payment acceptance however was very empty and not working our first day there.\\nThe service was good. When we asked for something they were quick to respond and get things for us and everyone was very nice.\\n\\nNearby activities: Walking disgrace to Eyre Square and many pubs.\",\n",

Also we had a nasty rug stain and a piece of chocolate sitting by the bed. We purposely left it there to see if our rooms were properly cleaned. Yet every night the same sticky stain, and chocolate sat there. Despite asking to clean the room with a cleaning employee, the stain and chocolate remained.

I'm not sure if it's a wedding, but it's near 12 am right now as i write this, and it is still going.\\nWe are very, very disappointed with the trip as we do not get to do it often with kids. Sad to say, we certainly won't be back again.\\nLet's just hope i don't have to add to this again when we have breakfast in the morning.

We had dinner in the room just off the bar\\nWe had starters which were okay, my dinner was cold, no one came to check on us and we the waiter gave us essert menus and after 20 minutes waiting for him to take our order, had to up and ask someone to come down yo us    There were 5 people including ourself for dinner and there were more staff than customers   When we  finished our meal, we asked the waiter thst had served us our food if we could sort out the bill for the meal. His response to my husband was \\\" What meal\\\" .....\\nTo add insult to injury, my husband signed for the bill to have it added to the room as we have always do and settle up when we check out..By the time we got back up to our room, approx 5 mins,  , the phone was ringing and the person on the other end was talking to my husband saying they were coming up to our bedroom with a credit card machine for payment of the dinner.....In all my years visiting hotels I have never heard the likes 9f it. It was as if they were closing the hotel overnight and needed all bills paid.\\nI cannot express what a huge disappointment is was to stay in your hotel and I certainly won't be staying again and will insure the girl that recommended it doesn't do so to anyone else\\nI suggest you pass this on to the management as they need to be aware of the issues within the hotel\\nI own 2 restaurants and I am fully aware of what good customer service is and it was not evident tonight\",\n",

It is a 5 minute walk or less to the train station, which was so nice considering we saved a lot of money not taking a cab or bus from the train to the hotel! It is close the to the town square where there are some pubs and shopping, and just beyond the square is the Latin Quarter which was the highlight of our time in Galway. I don't think we walked more than 15 minutes to get anywhere from the Galmont Hotel and Spa. Staff was very friendly, the add-on breakfast was delicious (it does get very busy at times), and the bar had great drinks and awesome food. The main restaurant had delicious food for a nice evening staying in. We did not try the pool or spa, but by the looks of many people carrying towels or in robes, it seems to be used regularly. The room was nice, bed was comfortable, and the room had climate control. Depending on which side you are facing, there are some great views of the town or the water. We would totally stay here again due to its proximity to the train station and the nightlife!\",\n",

Any one of these things is no big deal, but all together for the final price of almost 1,000k = not for us.\\n\\nThings happen, cultural differences, etc. - no biggie. I totes respect that. However, we had some obnoxious banging through the entire night that there was really no apology or even offer of compensate despite multiple reports from guests (see video). The next morning as we checked out the front desk said \\\"we've had multiple people have issues\\\" The staff member scribbled down our room number (along with many others) on the footer of a printout for something entirely different (hotel info sheet or something of the like). For the cost compared to other options, well just never stay here again is all. It was our splurge hotel during our trip to Ireland...\\n\\nTh HVAC/fan issues were after we encountered the following...\\n\\nWe got stuck on an elevator for a while + elevators would beep incessantly as they got stuck open on our floor multiple times a day.\\n\\nTo get out of the hotel there are several doors/options (automated) and every day one or the other was broken or hanging wide open letting cold air flow into the lobby/bar.\\n\\nThe elevator doors to the hotel spa were dented and dirty. Although the staff in the spa busted their butts for everyone!\\n\\nThe food at the at the hotel was bland compared to everything else in Galway. Plus, very expensive for way smaller portions or similar things offered elsewhere. I'd recommend many options (similar) plates in Galway for the cost that'll blow your mind.\\n\\nOur shower, despite our efforts, would leak/pool on the floor. The rubber under the door was molded and worn out.\\n\\nThe toilet needed one pump and then lifted up then down and held to flush each time.\\n\\nThe HVAC fan noises all night were the straw that broke the camel's back for us though + how little they cared that it was a pervasive issue (again, many room numbers written in the footer as they asked for payment)\\n\\nAgain, all little things and no big deal. However all together + how little they seemed to care about any of it + total cost of a room = not for us.

I would like to share my negative experiences as well, First of all, it is unbelievable that such a hotel charges 10 Euros per night to its guests in its own parking lot.  Not a huge amount, but do they need it? I think they should reevaluate this.\\nAnyway, the most negative experience we had at the hotel was about room cleaning. The toilet of the room we stayed in was not cleaned, the toilet lid was covered with dirt and the waste bin of the toilet was not taken. At the same time, we had to order the bathrobes and slippers because they were not available in the room. Actually, I wasn't going to write this review and I wasn't going to add the photos, but when I explained the situation after I checked out from the hotel at the reception, they said that they followed up with the housekeeper after my initial contact and the housekeeper said that the room was completely cleaned. So what I said was denied. I hope they were convinced when I showed them the photos. I think this is an individual experience, it can happen in all hotels, there is only a bad process management. To be fair the hotel overall is nice, location is great, but they need to be more sensitive about cleanliness and more responsive and proactive about process management.\",\n",

We forgot our international adapters and were told by front desk they had none to loan. Seems strange for a 4-star hotel catering to foreign travelers.

The breakfast is abundant although I didn't find it particularly tasty. The housekeeping was decent but the night tables and desk were left dusty for three days, although left empty, and the toilet flush was not working on day one; this was fixed when I reported it at the front desk. The bathroom has a decent size but, besides a rack on top of the toilet there was not a second hook to hang a towel, close to the shower or the sink, the water pressure was feeble. There was a usb charging port in the wall socket next to the bed but not at the desk, that's a pity. The bed and linens were good. The overall complementary services were decent too. I found it weird that they had food and drinks distributors working exclusively with coins and no coin distributor nor coins available at the front desk.  The moquette and furniture were a little dated and worn off so was the cutlery and dishes, cups,etc. The price of the rooms is slightly high, all considered, but aligned with the hotel category.\",\n",

This hotel seems like it wants to be a luxury hotel that is worthy of its purported 4 stars, but falls short of that in so many ways it should have it's stars revoked. Avoid staying here, find somewhere else.\\n\\nOur room was not overly clean and had fallen behind on its maintenance. There were clear signs of damage that had been haphazardly covered up, in one case with duct tape rather than any proper fix. There were scuff marks everywhere, and paint drips where they had quickly applied a sloppy coverup. The bathroom was riddled with mold, much of which would have been very easy to clean up had someone tried. Several of the fixtures were rusting, which was a common sight throughout the hotel. The elevators made scary screeching noises, another sign of poor maintenance practices.\\n\\nWe ended up getting room service because we walked out of the restaurant after being abandoned by the service down there. The room service took nearly an hour to bring up our simple order and the food was not good. It was edible, but continues the trend of the food at this hotel being the worst dining we have experienced in ireland, which so far had been great. They also brought our food up on dirty plates that clearly had not been cleaned properly. There was only a single napkin for 2 people, and they did not bring a knife for the steak. Our ice cream was melted and more of a soup. Additionally the individual serving container of ketchup that they provided had clearly been used previously as evidenced by it's broken seal and dried ketchup under the cap along with food stains on the bottle. A completely unacceptable level of bad service.\\n\\nAvoid this hotel, there has to be better places to stay in Galway that won't do a disservice to the wonderfulness that we have otherwise experienced in Ireland.\",\n",

      "    \"snippet\": \"room was fairly nice but the AC/furnace didn't work at all (even just the fan to move air around) and the window barely opened with no screen, so my room was insanely hot even though it's freezing outside. generally the entire hotel felt very warm. no stand alone fan in the room either. I know this may be a small thing for some people but I sleep very hot so made it very uncomfortable. I contacted maintenance as we were going out to lunch and was assured it would be taken care of, but came back to a sauna. restaurant for breakfast was fantastic but room service was mundane. burger patty, as well as the bacon, were completely burnt and pizza was cold by the time we got it. overall, I'd probably stay here again, but purely for lack of options.\\n\\nI will say that the staff was very friendly though, something I greatly appreciate!\",\n",

I cannot get any more literal about my experience.\\n\\nOriginally posted on 16/03/23.\\n\\nI made this account just to post this review. Hopefully it helps somebody.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, my experience is solely with being at an event in this establishment.\\n\\nIf you don't have time to read more into why I think this is the case, I will summarise:\\n\\n- the private security hired for the event (one of whom had no ID band) are told to force guests waiting in the lobby, after leaving the event, out of the door no matter what elements outside present themselves. (It was heavy rain in my case)\\n\\n- you have no option of re-entry. (They take off wristbands or any other identifying factor upon exiting the function room.)\\n\\n- service is fine at best, food is average as  expected for large events\\n\\n- after a few hours the function room gets very stuffy with very little ventilation. The only option for getting fresh air was a tiny, unsheltered, designated \\\"smoking\\\" area.\\n\\nTo continue I can't comment on whether or not the rooms besides the function room were of standard or not, however the location is convenient at most. You are better off considering another hotel to host an evening event at in Galway.\\n\\nTo get into the grits of it all:\\nThe standard that the security and reception treat individuals once they leave the function room (this was no later than 11pm with seemingly no evident possiblity of re-entry [they take wristbands off when leaving]) and head into the lobby can only be described as RUDE and COLD.\\nMy group were in suits and dresses, nevertheless we were ushered out into the lashing rain and told to go into the \\\"shelter\\\" (a high awning no thick as 50cm) that did nothing for the southerly wind that blew the rain onto us.\\n\\nThe security was forcing people out into the wind and heavy rain (regardless of whether waiting for a lift/taxi). After speaking to the security this was no doubt by order of the hotel itself simply to keep people out of the lobby. - *Mind you this was no later than 11pm and at previously ORGANISED event.*\\nThe security in the lobby were very snarky and rude. Making sly comments as people walked by and also making sarcastic comments to people inquiring as to why they were being forced into the rain. The hotel has much to answer for in this case.\\n\\nI have lost all respect for this hotel.\\n\\nMy advice ultimately is; if you are planning on having an event at this hotel that somewhat leads into the night; consider other options.\\n\\n-G\",\n",

The hotel is in a perfect location and staff in hotel were very helpful. My issue was with the spa. I was treated to a therapy along with my stay and the therapist yawned 4 times quite loudly over my head. I asked her was she tired and she laughed. I also had   an head massage along with a back massage but the head massage was the worst I have ever had. They therapist stayed massaging the same spot and did not even touch the back of my head or neck. My niece had a similar experience with her therapist and we mentioned it the person on the spa reception and we were offered our therapies free of charge. I hope my therapist was provided with extra training on how to behave professionally when dealing with clients. I won't be back in a hurry.\\nRoom was excellent and cannot fault it.

      "    \"snippet\": \"This isn’t a very good hotel. The problem is that they market it as a luxury spa hotel, but this doesn’t feel like a classy spa experience at all. The main problems are: (1) the air conditioning doesn’t really work. You wouldn’t think this would be a problem, but the sun comes in and the rooms roast. It looked like most people had their windows open which unfortunately means a ton of city noise. (2) the “spa” is across the street and consists of a pool, hot tub, steam room, and jacuzzi. They’re all pretty grungy and feels much, much more like a high school gym (right down to the broken lockers) than any sort of relaxing experience. You also won’t have robes and slippers by default so you’ll have to request those too. (3) the rooms are clean enough, strictly speaking, as-in we didn’t ever have a gross moment. That being said, there’s a lot of dust everywhere, everything is dated and old, and just a little beat up. Not a big deal, but again not the luxury spa experience they’re going for. (4) there’s construction going on. This may be a good thing if they’re trying to update things, but when it’s a few doors down and there’s loud drilling and music going on in the morning it’s not great.\\n\\nThe staff at the front was friendly, the location is awesome for arriving / departing / accessing the city, and the rooms were clean. This hotel should just be more upfront with what they are so you can plan accordingly.\",\n",

It should be 1 star.\\n\\nWe stayed at The Galmont for two nights at a cost of just over 500.00 euros - my husband paid for an upgraded room. Check in was supposed to be 4 pm. We arrived about 3:44 and room was not ready. No worries, we were 15 minutes early.\\n\\nHusband had to log into work. At 4:10, I asked about our room and was told engineering had to check to be sure AC worked. Our room was to be in the newly remodeled section. I asked for a quiet area for my husband to work. I was told there was no place available. They gave us two drink vouchers which we did not use.\\n\\nAt 4:30 I asked for a second time about a quiet place for my husband to take business calls. I was under the impression we were being led to a conference room. However, a reception worker led us to the sofas outside conference rooms where we quickly discovered there was a dance competition. Teenagers we’re back and forth and their coordinator was extremely loud.\\nWhen husband sat on the sofa, he discovered it was broken.  I had to shut conference room doors on the kids more than once.\\n\\nWe finally got our room at 5:30, I brought luggage up on a cart so husband could finish his work call.\\n\\nHere is where it gets really interesting.\\n\\nI took the elevator up and followed directions to our room. I felt like I was in The Shining - our room was at end of long hall which was a construction zone and felt abandoned: mattresses lined the hall, side walls still had spackle, it just was not ready for guests. I had to pull a mattress out of the way so I could get the luggage cart down hall. I’m still stunned they had a guest go down that hall!\\n\\nOur room was at the very end of the hall.  I get there and it had a strong smell of paint. Husband comes up to room. He questioned whether I could stay there due to paint fumes being a migraine trigger. I said we’d have to stay since the hotel was fully booked. Then husband went to use the bathroom but the bathroom door wouldn’t close - it was hung wrong!\\n\\nRemember, we waited 1.5 hours for engineering to verify ac worked? It did not: it started fine but a minute later posted an error; an engineer went to main environmental control to determine a fix. He returned and said it was no good. Room was simply not ready for guests.\\n\\n7:05 pm Husband called reception desk to ask for new room but was told hotel is full. Husband makes second call and asks for supervisor. Tells supervisor we need another room or refund for us to go elsewhere. We were offered a bottle of red wine but we declined as we were miserable and had lost an evening in Galway.\\n\\nSupervisor comes to room. We show him bathroom door doesn’t close, error on environmental controls, and drawers of desk don’t open. Supervisor seemed shocked at the state of our room.\\n\\nFinally, the manager takes us to new room at 7:13 pm - 3 hours and 13 minutes past check in. Mgr offered bottle of Prosecco. I had lost patience and said how about dinner. He spoke of restaurant, I countered with room service - we just wanted to finally settle in for the night. Supervisor did comp room service for our dinner.\\n\\nOverall, after nearly a month throughout Europe and Ireland, we had our worst hotel experience at the Galmont. It ruined our opinion of Galway and we were happy to leave for our next destination.\\n\\nMy recommendation: unless you are staying at the Galmont for a conference or competition, there are better options close by.\\n\\nThey severely overcharge for the quality of their rooms and service when compared to similarly priced accommodations in London, Amsterdam and multiple locations in Ireland. They were closest in quality to the AC Hotel in Belfast, which was significantly cheaper.\",\n",

The towels were thin and felt like sandpaper. The pillows were flat and hard. The hot was nearly nonexistent.  Their breakfast buffet was horrible. It lacked fresh food, contained fruit which was browned and eggs that were cold. Finally, the walls were incredibly thin and you could hear everything going on in the next room as well as the hallway. And trust me, there was a lot going on in the next room – wink.

But it was a very quick walk to the SPA, only a longer distance to the restaurant and bar, but it wasn't a problem for us. Unfortunately, if you arrive with a car, you will have to pay 10€ per night for parking.\\nThe room is tidy with a very, very large bed. The hotel staff was very nice and polite.  For breakfast there was a lot of different food which was very tasty and also a variety of coffee, tea and juice.\\nFor dinner at the restaurant, we chose a 4-course menu (€90 for two) with a bottle of wine and were also surprised by the good quality and delicious food.\\nThe main SPA has a swimming pool, jacuzzi, two different saunas and an outdoor hot tub. Don't forget to have 1€ with you, it is needed in the locker. Also, if you want to swim in the pool, you will need a swimming cap (you can buy it at the entrance for €3)\\nIf that wasn't enough you can go to The Thermal Suite at the Spirit One Spa for an additional fee (€15 per person as a hotel resident). It has an artificial beach with real sand where you can lie down and relax, as well as 4 different saunas and HEATED RELAXATION LOUNGERS.\\nAfter these pleasures, you can relax in the dedicated room where you can enjoy with cup off coffee, tea and fruits.\\n\\n•HEATED RELAXATION LOUNGERS\\nHeated to a comfortable 36°C and designed in an ergonomic shape to offer your body the most relaxed position it can take.\\n•THE LACONIUM\\nOffers a dry, gentle heat in a more relaxed environment, with scented citrus oils and gentle light therapy.\\n•EXPERIENCE SHOWERS\\nThree showers, offering between them essential oils and water in the form of invigorating tropical rain and a light cool mist to refresh your mind and body between cabins.\\n•THE ROCK SAUNA\\nThis is the hottest and driest of our thermal experiences at 85°C to 90°C, ideal for swift detoxification and invigoration.\\n•SABIA MED\\nExplore the wonders of the Sabia med or \\\"beach\\\" as it is better known to our guests, taking you through a meditative dawn to dusk light cycle whilst lying on a warm tropical beach.\",\n",

To make matters worse, one of the elevators was out but no one at the front desk could set any expectations around that.   Overall, I’m giving them a low score because of the lack of communication.  We had breakfast in the Marina’s restaurant twice and that was not a pleasant experience and most of it self-serve so interaction with the staff should have been minimal.  I witnessed waiters wiping off tables with dirty rags and not doing a good job.  I literally had to ask for the table to be wiped again.  I understand that everyone is busy but I’m talking more about basic training.  For example, it took 4 times to ask for cream with our coffee.  It took 3 visits to the kitchen to finally get enough coffee for the three of us who were drinking it.  It was frustrating to say the least.  It was quite bizarre to watch our waiter go back to the kitchen and come back with just one cup and then return to kitchen to get two more.   The food was decent for a hotel breakfast Buffett but overall, there is just an energy of chaos.  Checking was also chaotic.  It two people to finally figure out that somehow, my room was double booked.  I was with a party of friends and they mixed our rooms up so the amenities I ordered ended up in another person’s room.  Eventually things got figured out but it took much direction from me to make that happen.  Overall, I had a sense of “no one was in charge”.  Maybe we just caught the staff in a bad week but I wouldn’t stay here again.  There is just too many options to choose from to deal with the confusion.\",\n",

The leisure centre and outdoor hot tub were amazing! The staff were very nice and accommodating. Only big downside to this hotel is the fact that you have to PAY for PARKING. We payed over €700 in this hotel between accommodation, food & drink etc, yet at check out we were still handed a bill of €9 per night for just simple parking the car. I personally think this is a really low blow from the hotel, if you’re going to charge high enough rates to customers, parking should be included/free.

      "    \"snippet\": \"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at The Galmont and would return. The beds were SO comfortable, rooms were spacious, and the hotel is lovely. Staff were very friendly. We were in what seemed like the farthest room possible from the lobby - when we looked out our window we could actually see the lobby/elevators across the lot. We got a good laugh at that and enjoyed our quiet east wing of the hotel. The hotel is located less than a 5 min walk from the train station, and not too far from the main part of the city.\\nSome issues we encountered, which is why I left off one star: (1) Money disappearing from our room. We had roughly 12 euro in coins (for bus fare) on the table in our room. We left the coins there while we did a 10hr guided tour as the coins were cumbersome to carry. When we returned and the money was gone, we called and reported it. We informed them that perhaps housekeeping thought it was a tip, but we needed the money for bus fare. They said they would investigate but we seemingly did not hear back. If they called while we were out, no message was left on the hotel phone, our cell phone was not called, and there was no mention of it at check out. (2) The classic rooms do not have air conditioning and the room became quite stuffy. To compensate, we kept the window open and used the provided fan. (3) Dangerous bathtub/shower combo. The bathtub is rounded inside and is very tall. This made it difficult to keep your footing, especially when exiting, as you had a far way to step out and down. They did provide a non slip bath mat but the tub was generally uncomfortable to use for this reason. (4) This is a small thing…my husband got a sudden migraine in the middle of eating dinner. He ran back to the room because he becomes physically ill with migraines. We hadn’t touched our main course yet so I asked the restaurant if they could box our food to bring to the room. While our waiter was very nice, all he offered was to wrap the plates in tin foil for me to carry to my room. As mentioned earlier, we were very far from the lobby so I had to navigate elevators, long hallways, and opening a hotel door with two very heavy plates in my hands. At a 4 star hotel I just would’ve expected someone to lend a quick helping hand for a sick guest.\",\n",

The “classic” rooms don’t have AC which they don’t advertise well. Also the classic rooms, which are also the lowest cost, are extremely hard to get to - so they are kind of discriminating against those with disabilities by making their lowest cost option the cheapest. One of the servers in the marina for breakfast was rude and not welcoming and the food looked pretty disgusting so we didn’t end up eating there. I’d look elsewhere\",\n",

The breakfast was a bit mediocre, like you'd find it in any other cheaper hotel. The bar was good apart from being obviously understaffed. All the extra amenities were fantastic like the spa, gym and pool. House keeping was non existent. We were told on arrival that there would be no cleaning or servicing of the room each day due to COVID-19. I know that this is not true. These hotels have policies of cleaning the rooms and changing the linen every two days, the COVID-19 excuse was just to cover up that they had booked too many rooms and did not have the staff to clean them all. The hotel is extremely understaffed and it is so obvious.\\nThe poor girl that was serving us drinks one night was run off here feet. She told us she had to serve the whole lounge and terrace by herself.\\nSeveral of the lights in our room were not working. The room itself was tiny for what we were paying. We were not given new towels everyday or even every other day. We had to go down to reception to ask for more. Overall for a four star hotel our room was small and ugly, there was no house keeping, and we basically had to clean the room ourselves. I've had better service in hostels. Not worth the money we payed. The hotel has no sense of luxury at all once you get past the lounge and bar area. Honestly we went here for a romantic getaway and it was very disappointing.\",\n",

This makes a huge difference and allowed us to drop our bags and go straight out and enjoy our day instead of hanging around to check in.\\n\\nThe girl at the desk was really friendly ,helpful ,chatty and you felt she really cared about giving you the very best and Warmest care for our stay.\\n\\nThe Room was cool but with a good working air con that could be easily adjusted.The bed was huge and Comfy , though the Pillows needed to be fuller as they felt very flat. The Bathroom clean tidy and shower easy to use. Overall the room was very comfortable.\\n\\nAfter being out for the whole day in the cool Salthill wind we arrived back to the hotel where we found a fabulous fire  that lured us to have a night cap at the bar . The Piano was being played and set a lovely ambience. The barman was still chatty and smiling despite being late in the day.\\n\\nBreakfast was open until 11am meaning you didnt have to be up too early to enjoy. This place was packed with a continuous flow of people .There didnt look like there was a table free but the Lovely charming chap that brought us in found one with ease,  always confident there would be one available .\\nBreakfast was a well oiled machine in this place. I went up to the buffet and by the time i returned to my table the coffee had been ordered and on the table ready. Sublime service. All the usual breakfast choices readily available as well as the staff if there were any special orders.  No panicking or rushing around by the staff for such a busy time just smiling happy and efficient .Tables cleaned and ready in seconds to an impeccable standard.\\n\\nAt Check out we were greeted again with a warm greeting.Swift efficient and well wishes for our travels.\\n\\nThe staff make this place.Through hard work , warm welcomes and top level efficiency we are definitely going back again.\\n\\nWell Done you should all be Very Very Proud of yourselves  for the work you do daily.\",\n",

I’d prefer less coloured flashing lights and more classical rooms like the steam room. The showers were broken (the steam portion broken) and need to be updated.\\n\\nThe pool upstairs was ok-although when I went there were screaming kids which was disappointing. I work a lot and wanted some quiet alone time. Both hot tubs were literally lukewarm.\\n\\nUsed the float tub as well and it was lovely, although also lukewarm.\\n\\nMoving from Canada, I’m actually cold in Ireland all the time. Housing (and even workspaces) here don’t have central heating, so it’s taken a lot to adjust to feeling freezing cold all the time and seeing my breath indoors, and not having a bathtub in my rental.\\n\\nSo I was hoping to treat myself and warm up at Spirit One. The hot tubs were really disappointing as was the lukewarm float tub.

Service is painfully slow even though it was not overly busy, cocktail menu is cut down to two options, anyone with a food allergy can forget about getting food because any options they claim to have they will be out of on the day even when notified in advance of dietary requirements. Some members of our party had to wait forty minutes for their food after everyone else at the table had finished eating. It was next to impossible to get the attention of staff for drinks or menus. Extremely disappointing as I have stayed in the hotel before so had expected great things only to be let down.\",\n",

      "    \"snippet\": \"Personally I think this was an ok hotel. We stayed for 2 nights for €400. I really appreciated the extras that were provided for the birthday, a candle, they sang for my fiancé at dinner. It was lovely. The room was nice and clean as well with a nice  river view. The gym was also good. And location is close to the city.\\n\\nBut I found some of the staff either miss communicating or forgetful. We asked for towel and some more tea for our room. They haven’t brought it up for ages so we left for the town. When we got it they gave us lots of coffee sashes instead of tea bags. They didn’t give us new towels every day, or more water I think the hotel may be very understaffed.  Breakfast tasted like a cheap hotel buffet. It made us both feel a bit ill every morning. My fiancé asked for a cappuccino, had to get up to ask for it again. It was brought when he finished his food. The spa facility wasn’t that amazing the one thing that redeems it is the outdoor hot tub, but all of it is also available to the public, so if you come down on a busy day when the public comes you may not even get the chance to use it. And the whole pool and the area felt a bit too cold. I was shivering swimming.\\n\\nThe thermal spa costs extra, we’re told it  closed when we came in even though later we saw someone come out of it.  This did not feel like a 4 star hotel. It’s over priced for the service we got and not to mention also the €9 parking as well per night.\",\n",

They then got the bill wrong so we had to wait some more for that. Nice hotel, just don't use the restaurant.\",\n",

      "    \"snippet\": \"The hotel is impressive in the lobby but unfortunately that’s were it ends. Food is poor and drinks are over priced. We paid nearly €600 for 2 nights in a balcony room but wouldn’t return. We requested house keeping on the 2nd day of our stay and were told we had to be out of the room for this. We had a saunter around Galway after breakfast as our house keeping was booked for 11am. When we returned at 12 there was no house keeping done. We tried for over 30 minutes to ring reception/house keeping and no one answered. My wife had to ring through an outside line to get someone in reservations. The front of house manager then returned our call and explained that it was because of checkout time and the staff were busy. This is not a reason to not answer phones to guests. What if there was an accident? We were then advised to use the leisure centre whilst house keeping cleaned our room but there was nothing to use as steam room and jacuzzi were out of use because of Covid   The sauna and outdoor tub was open for limited users and the place was packed so we were left standing around. The FOH manager gave us two drink vouchers as an apology for the misunderstanding but when we went to use them we were told there was a €6 limit of each voucher    Plus we were waiting 25 minutes for 2 bottles of beer at 4pm in the afternoon. The Bar was at 20% capacity with one Bar man working but we counted at least 15 floor staff. There is more I could add to this review but it would turn into a novel. Needless to say we would not be returning to the Galmont.\",\n",

This is not what we were suggesting so it was quite insulting. Staff weren’t very welcoming or attentive and huddled in groups in the restaurant chatting and playing with their hair, which is extremely unhygienic especially with the handling of food and drink. We had a drink in the bar and had to witness several people getting thrown out of the hotel which was very disruptive.

I received a call from the manager of the spa apologising for her staffs poor behaviour.. I was offered a treatment for the following day which I declined.

I know the organiser of the hen emailed back and forth explaining there would be a vegan well in advance, as we were prepaying dinner with our stay in the hotel. I also rang and told reception I would be there etc and would there be a vegan option available. The guy on the phone was lovely and assured me they had vegans stay all the time and there would of course be options for me.\\nAt the dinner, no vegan options were offered and the lovely lady serving us seemed surprised by my request. She brought me out a small bowl of green leaves, 2 Slices of tomato and some raw shaved onion as my starter. I told her I was disappointed with this and she said she could get me a different dressing. Same story with the main, they said the burger could be done vegan but it came out with mayonnaise on it, which I scraped off. My dessert was one of the fruit pots they serve at breakfast. I was so disappointed. The galmount has such a great reputation and is very pricey, but the food was such a letdown. I mentioned it again at check out and although the woman was lovely there was no real apology made and looking back I wish I had asked for a partial refund for the meal because it really was awful.

Service was very bad we would be waiting ages before any staff came near us for a drink or when we ordered they would forget. 12.50 for a cocktail that tasted like ice our table and two other tables sent there's back. They had a cocktail menu but were missing most of them Our room was had one window and when i opened the curtain we were looking down at reception so we could hear all in our room and couldnt open window to let fresh air in. Upon checking out after paying 380 we were charged 9 euro a night for parking. Very disappointing stay for that price. You are paying for location thats it.\\n\\nSent\",\n",

On the last night I couldn’t wait to go back home and we would usually never ever be like that , normally we would be freaked that we have to leave but this was the first time something was completely off. When checking in we didn’t receive a welcoming smiling atmosphere all we got is oh is it your first time ok welcome so your booked in for 3 nights breakfast and dinner that way and that’s about it … we’re as usually for a 4 star hotel they would make you feel welcomed and comfortable, have a nice chat with you tell you what room your in etc. Got none of that . Dinner/breakfast service must say was very poor … waited a long time and when asking for a simple thing like could we get still water instead of sparkling we waited about 20 minutes and then we didn’t get any glasses to pour the water into . I got a dessert after my dinner the first night and it never came I waited like 40 minutes till my boyfriend had to pull one of the waitresses and tell them and then I got it 5 minutes later. Breakfast was no different, food was very average but food wasn’t as nice as any other place we have been too and we couldn’t put a finger on it as to why that is… service we got for first day was poor again asking have we been to breakfast before and we said no and all that was told to Us was ok buffet over there and continental food over there enjoy… never told about no pancakes or poached eggs etc. Like one of the couples got on the third day before we were checking out .very very poor. On the second day when we got a table given to us and when we came back with our food it was given to someone else and bless the pair that were sitting there they were going to give it to us as they probably knew it was for us but we just found another one as it wasn’t there fault what so ever . Room service menu also not given in the room as we tried getting it and they told us there is a special menu for it but we did not have this so when we did order the food they rang us back to tell us one thing can’t be gotten which was disappointing… no lights out on the balcony and all the ones next to us had lights turned on besides ours and we checked every switch to make sure we didn’t miss it but there was none for outside . I could go on but overall very poor and unpleasant experience, would definitely not recommend it to anyone far more friendlier ,nicer and cheaper 4 stars out there .\",\n",

I caused disappointment but I gave a vote of confidence to the room, when we arrived the views were oriented to a warehouse roof, I mean that fantastic, we started well. I started to get cold in the afternoon, and the heating did not work, it was completely off or not working, instead I had a ridiculous little oil heater that could barely heat the room, that is not typical of a 4 star hotel, I spent 204 € for a night in which I sincerely thought it was expensive for what I was offered.

      "    \"snippet\": \"The MHL Hotel Collection have a good portfolio of hotels but there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before they become bigger problems. I’ve a feeling that profit over guest experience is the main goal. Long term restructuring would better achieve a more fulfilling stay for their guests as well as a profitable and well run hotel chain.\\n\\nParking in Galway is at a premium so you have to pay €9 a day to park in the Galmont Hotel underground car park which is badly laid out, the spaces are limited & very tight.\\n\\nMaking the initial booking directly with the Galmont for two rooms over the phone ended up confusing & the request was mixed up. The confirmation email only contained a booking for one room and we had to contact the Galmont again.\\n\\nOn the confirmation email you have to click a link to book dinner and breakfast. Neither of those bookings came through with a confirmation.\\n\\nWhen checking in, we had to ask for the second room on the booking, which initially was a surprise to the staff and then they found it.\\n\\nWhen checking in to one of the rooms, luckily the guests next door let us know that they were late night drinking buddies as they had left a huge tray of empty Guinness pint glasses, a bottle of wine and gin & tonic glasses outside their room.\\n\\nThe staff on the main desk were extremely helpful when I asked to switch rooms and explained why. As I was returning to the old room to pick up my bags, one of the porters was already swiftly removing the empty drinks tray. Godspeed new neighbours.\\n\\nHad two nice pints of Guinness at the bar.\\nCrispy chicken wings were delicious for starters in the main restaurant. The meat in the burger was also very good. Eton Mess for dessert has very little cream (if you like it with lots of cream).\\n\\nBreakfast has a selection of fruit in a dish (wrapped in cellophane), yoghurt pots, cereals & hot breakfast. You ask the chef for specific items, scrambled eggs or fried eggs, sausages, rashers etc and he puts them on a plate for you.\\n\\nThe toast, croissant and small danish basket, weren’t fresh.\\n\\nThe towels need softener, they’re good for exfoliating but are at the end of their use and need to be replaced.\\n\\nThe beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is clean. The cleaners didn’t hover under a moveable piece of furniture, when I pushed it aside I found wrappers underneath.\\n\\nThe lift software needs updating. Both lifts  go to a floor when called, instead of recognising that the other lift has already picked up the initial caller.\\n\\nExperiences I’ve had in other MHL Hotel Collection are similar in that they are charging a premium rate, in once premium hotel locations but for a less than premium experience from this group.\",\n",

The line to be seated for breakfast was ridiculously long the first two mornings we were there. Clearly they needed an additional staff member to seat people. On the last morning there we left so early that we ended up paying for full Irish breakfast, but walked out with an apple, banana and cup of tea because that's all they had to offer. I was NOT happy about that. Ordered room service the second night, just a pizza, and after an hour I had to call again to find out what was going on. They said it would be right up. Thirty minutes later it arrived. We informed the front desk and they removed the delivery charge from our bill. The pizza itself was nothing special and the night before when we ate in the restaurant the food was unremarkable and the service,  although friendly,  was slow even though they were not busy. The pool was slimy. We were both slipping at the edges by the steps. Pictures posted make it look like hotel is right on the water, but in fact there is a busy road in between. It is conveniently located near the train and bus station and not a far walk from everything worth seeing and doing in Galway.  If we had to do it all over again,  we would not stay here.\",\n",

We were welcomed by the receptionist very politely and professionally. On arrival to the room we were pleased to see that it was quite spacious and warm. The bathroom was very clean and tidy and the bedroom was without fault. Beautiful beds and lighting. The swimming pool was excellent but the temperature of the pool was quite cold. We used to Jacuzzi instead because the water was very cold. The quality of the Jacuzzi was not great and the ten minute timer had us cold again. The advertised hot tub we seen during booking was out of order when we arrived and no water in it at all. The bar food was not to the standard we payed for, very overpriced for mediocre food. The restaurant and sushi bar was closed also during our stay so we didn't even get to enjoy a fancy meal in the hotel. The service in the bar was very poor. We had to wait over half an hour after we finished our food to get the bill and have our dishes taken off us despite asking numerous times. Although it was not busy.The pillows and blankets in the room were not very comfortable and had a plastic feel. The pillows would not fluff and just sank when we lay on them. Very uncomfortable. Woke up with a sore back.\\n\\nOverall we enjoyed our stay, aside from the poor comments above it would have been 5 stars. We still enjoyed our stay at The Galmont Hotel and would come back again.\",\n",

We booked twin and access as there wasn't much to choose from booking last minute so we have picked two different rooms to see what would be the difference (I don't mind access rooms as I wasn't expecting it too be just way behind other 4* hotels standards). Selecting our hotel was based on location for this trip - which is perfect in fact. 5 minutes walk from the train station and located basically close to major places in town.\\nThere wasn't anything outstanding about service we've received, however Brendan at the check-out was very customer service oriented - Thank You.\\n\\nIt seem to me it was one of the oldest and most \\\"tired\\\" floor / room / maybe whole hotel I've seen. Rooms are far from being enjoyable. White bulbs for daylight, yellow bulbs for reading (side lamp). Very few TV channels some with breaking image. No radio channels, no music channels no HDMI ports. Mirror placed too high to see yourself while sitting beside the desk - you would face bottom of mirror frame. Shower curtains too short - flooding whole bathroom after one shower (access rm). Towels gets wet too easily as they are too close and too low, no other place to put them. There was clothes retractable string dryer but too close to curtain and not usable for towels. Furniture old, noisy and very tired. Minibar was empty...sadly. Available toiletry was basically same products under different label (for example shampoo and shower gel).\\n\\nBreakfast was served in to our room - hot and Fresh! Thank you.\\n\\nOn the desk, there was a letter explaining...renovation process - too much about the hotel and nothing about their guests. Hotel seem to proud of themselves but in fact there isn't much they could be proud about apart of one only thing that surprised me.\\nIt's difficult to remember all places you would sleep in but I think they do have most amazing mattresses I was ever sleeping on.\\n\\nWhile most traveling customers would agree that comfortable and enjoyable sleep is every hotel most important task, taking shortcuts with everything else wouldn't make me personally come back and recommend it - photography is main reason for my journeys and HDMI connectivity is as important to me as anything else most four star hotels does offer but not this one. I was not pleased reading that letter after seeing how poor my room was.\",\n",

The concierge that checked us in, didn't tell us anything about the hotel except what floor our room was on and where the restaurant was for breakfast.\\n\\nOur first room was dirty and disappointing, when we returned to the check in desk a very nice man (Dermot I think) was helpful and got our room switched after notifying the manager, and even walked us to our room offering to take our bags and to ensure we were happy. The second room was better.\\n\\nBreakfast was a bit slow, they seemed short of staff, and we tried different times both days. I was sitting next to a man who was telling his associate that he had waited 25 minutes for coffee the previous morning and in the end went to his room to make his own.\\n\\nThere was no real information in the room pack regarding the spa that is supposed to be complimentary in the stay. This was the main reason I paid the extra to stay at the radisson.\\nAfter asking concierge information about the spa all they told us was there are lockers and changing rooms in the spa, and there's towels provided. When we turned up at the spa there were two staff manning the desk, we had to ask for assistance after dawdling a minute. We were then informed we needed to wear swimming caps (which was mentioned in the info pack) if we wanted to use the pool. This isn't mentioned on any of the sites when booking the hotel. We were then informed that the swimming hats were to be purchased if you hadn't provided your own and they were €3 each. We were told if we didn't purchase these we could only use the hot tubs and sauna. We had left our belongings in our room since we were heading down to use the pool and I didn't fancy a 15 minute walk to collect €6 so we used the hot tub and left. I was immensely disappointed as we were intending to book in for massages etc since it was our 10 year anniversary.\\n\\nAll in all I think it was one of the most disappointing stays I've ever had and it cost me £250 for the experience. We could have stayed at the local hotel around the corner and felt happier - which ironically is where we spent most of our time. Wouldn't stay again.\",\n",

Every member of staff we came across from reception, bar and restaurant were distant to say the least. Not one of them smiled once. The food was extremely lacklustre. Reasonably priced for a 4 star establishment but I couldn't finish my tasteless shepherd's pie, and I'm not a fussy eater. My partner didn't finish his chowder either. Many better chowders out there in the pubs of Galway. We ordered an extra side of mac and cheese to try to fill up but that too was disappointing. Fruit salad for breakfast was lovely but the cooked breakfast my partner had was dried and eggs not nice. Bed was absolutely amazing, the quilt, mattress and pillows made for the dreamiest night's sleep I've had in a long time. All other features of the room were outdated, worn or misplaced. Have used the spa in the past and will return many times again.\",\n",

So our plans got cancelled pretty swiftly as we couldn't shower etc. We got back to the hotel and were put in a room that was so noisy (it overlooked the terrace of the bar) that we didn't sleep. It was our first time in Galway in a very long time and because of the Galmont it was ruined to be quite honest. I can't even begin to tell you guys how dissappointed I am right now.

      "    \"snippet\": \"This is unfortunately a three-star hotel masquerading as a four-star.  It's clean, bright, airy and spacious, but the service was somewhat lacking.\\n\\nRooms: we had a family room - >king size bed and large twin beds. There were only round (European? American?) sockets on the bed side of the room (anyone with a sleep apnoea machine or wanting their phone nearby charging overnight would be screwed).  Other side of room had two normal sockets - not enough for the two electric room heaters (needed!), floor lamps, minifridge, desk lamp, kettle - or things like our 4 phones and tablet...\\n\\nBar: Went to the hotel bar while waiting to check in (you can't check in until 4pm). Was told they didn't serve food there (it was the only place with a TV and I wanted to watch the France v Ireland 6 Nations game).  At half-time, ran over to the restaurant where one person told me they couldn't bring food over to the bar; another told me of course they could (and she did).  Better communication (and customer service!) needed.  Bar counter was wet with spilled drink - only those waxy paper beermats available rather than actually absorbent ones. Nobody wiped down the bar counter while I was there.\\n\\nFamily had lunch in the restaurant, I got a sandwich delivered to bar - food was ok, nothing great.\\n\\nBar had usual Diageo brands, and local Galway Hooker Pale Ale on tap.\\n\\nBreakfast is self-service buffet; unfortunately not many staff on, saw fried eggs were dry/congealed, other cooked food was lukewarm at best; waited 20 minutes for clean glasses to be brought out for juice.  Disappointing, as a good 'full Irish' is one of life's treats when on holiday or a break.\\n\\nSunday night, Valentine's night, we were told they stopped serving cocktails at 11:30...\\n\\nParking charge of €5/day which is cheap, but obviously doesn't show up in room rate when comparing room prices.  And to be honest, a hotel charging guests to park is just penny-pinching meanness.\",\n",

It's not just the disappointment that he's not the friendly person I expected. It's just -  I try so much so they don't think they're old.

    "**Code Explanation:** The code uses the SerpApi service to retrieve Google Maps reviews for a specific location, identified by a `data_id`. It sets up search parameters with an API key, specifies Google Maps reviews as the search engine, and sets the language to English. The script then enters a loop to fetch reviews page by page, incrementing the `page_num` with each iteration. Reviews are collected into a list with details like the user's name, link, thumbnail, rating, and whether they are a local guide. If there is an error or no more pages, the loop breaks. Pagination is handled by updating the search parameters with the next page token if available. Finally, it prints out the collected reviews in a JSON format, with proper indentation and encoding to handle non-ASCII characters."

      "Document 1: We came to this hotel with a tour company. The lobby is so beautiful and welcoming.  However, the hotel is very large and oddly shaped and there are rooms in a 1200 & 1300 block that are quite hard to find and I got lost multiple times coming from or to these rooms. We also had several rooms where we found the beds were not up to hotel standards.  In the room I was in there were many long black hairs as though after making the bed someone laid down and relaxed. We also had several rooms that we had asked for double occupancy for multiple people to be in the room and we found the rooms to be 2 twin beds pushed together and even made a 1 bed with the sheets in 1 room. This is not that bad as we just moved the beds but we did give a list with the details and it seems going that extra mile would have been the difference.  There was also quite a bit of dust and spider webs in the stairwells.\n",
      "The food was pretty good and you get plenty. Though our St Patrick's Day Cheesecake everyone had a different thickness in their Graham cavorting crust. And they did not seem to make their portions uniform in the main dishes.  Our first night's dinner the Roasted chicken dishes varied wildly from plate to plate in size.  Sorry no pivots as I didn't know everyone so I don't have the pictures of everyone's food.  But my chicken was the smallest one at the table everyone else was about 15-20% large pieces. I didn't have it but they said the Chocolate Mousse was wonderful!\n",
      "For vending machines I earn you that the one in the 1200 block of the hotel will only take coins and no credit card or mobile payment.  The one buy the main elevator on the 1st floor had a mobile payment acceptance however was very empty and not working our first day there.\n",
      "The service was good. When we asked for something they were quick to respond and get things for us and everyone was very nice.\n",

      "Document 2: A good hotel in a perfect location. The only downside is the hotel bar - Coopers bar. Service here is well below average. It's like they try to do anything else but serve you. Especially the barman with a beard and tattoos. Watched him ignore patrons like it was his job. If you're worried about having too much to drink, come here. It'll never happen. Shame, as the rest of the hotel is very nice.\n",
      "Document 3: Don’t stay here unless you like hotels where literally no one cares about anything. It is chaotic. Check in was after 4 as room wasn’t ready which is just way too late. Coffees ordered at the bar while we were waiting were forgotten about. Filthy tables. They moved us to a new room as ours wasn’t going to be ready until 5pm but cot not set up in room and no bath in family room which seems like an odd decision. Wine ordered ahead of time no sign of. Room cold and noisy. No mention of pool or any other services. They just don’t care in this massive hotel, which fair enough but I would discourage anyone from staying here.\n",
      "Update: There is an obnoxious party in hotel so it’s even noisier sounds like we’re above a nightclub and had to get a portable heater as heating in room is broken   . If we had known the hotel was going to have a party until 2am we obviously would not have booked this ‘family friendly’ hotel.\n",

      "First off, we had food in the restaurant, which was pretty good, but the service was bad. The server never came back to see if we needed anything once we got served, and we did need some extra service.\n",
      "The room looks nice and clean apart from when you flush the toilet it is like a generator buzzing to fill again.\n",
      "The heat couldn't be adjusted in our room also, it was way too hot, and if we opened the window, it was even louder again from the noise outside.\n",
      "The big kicker was, they knew we had a baby and a young toddler and they put us in a room above the front entrance on the 3rd floor, is it so loud we can't sleep, the music is vibrating through the room and the sound of people outside shouting and whatnot. I'm not sure if it's a wedding, but it's near 12 am right now as i write this, and it is still going.\n",
      "We are very, very disappointed with the trip as we do not get to do it often with kids. Sad to say, we certainly won't be back again.\n",
      "Let's just hope i don't have to add to this again when we have breakfast in the morning. Music and party went on til 2am, people shouting and roaring til 3am. I will be looking for a complete refund from this joke of a so called 4-star hotel.\n",

      "Perfect location. Service was a complete letdown. So much so we complained about the meal in the restaurant.  Breakfast was not great. And the bar staff and receptionists were not so friendly. In one situation after the disaster of a meal waiting for about 2.5 hours on a dinner with a toddler had to hand back and was spoken to so rude I just had to walk away. I feel for a four-star there definitely needs to be more staff or a little refresh on customer service\n"

It then creates a new column, 'language', in the cleaned DataFrame `df_no_null` by applying the `detect_language` function to each 'snippet'. Next, it filters `df_no_null` to include only those rows where the detected language is English, storing the result in a new DataFrame named `all_reviews`. This results in `all_reviews` containing only the English-language reviews."

A function `segregate_customers` is created to sort reviews into these categories based on the presence of category-specific keywords. Another function `classify_customers` assigns a category label to each review. This classification is then applied to all reviews in the `all_reviews` DataFrame, adding a new column 'segregated_customers'. Lastly, it prints the DataFrame with the snippets and their newly assigned customer categories."

Then it plots the ROC curves for each model on a graph, using a dashed line to represent a chance-level classifier. The plot visually compares the performance of the three models, with AUC providing a measure of their ability to distinguish between classes. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting true positives while minimizing false positives."

    "**Graph interpretation:** \n",
    "1) The graph presented is a comparative display of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for three distinct models. In this depiction, it is shown that the Random Forest model outperforms its counterparts with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) scoring at 0.92. This suggests a generally superior capability of the Random Forest model in accurately classifying the positive class, as evidenced by its higher True Positive Rate (TPR) across most False Positive Rate (FPR) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Following the Random Forest is the Logistic Regression model, which boasts an AUC of 0.85, indicating commendable performance. Although not as high as the Random Forest model, an AUC of this magnitude is generally considered to reflect a high level of accuracy in classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The Naive Bayes model is observed to have the lowest AUC of 0.82 amongst the three, which, while surpassing the performance of random chance, denotes a comparatively less effective class differentiation capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is concluded from the graph that the Random Forest model demonstrates the most adept performance for the specified task, with Logistic Regression being a close second. Despite its lower performance, the value of the Naive Bayes model cannot be overlooked, particularly for its simplicity and expediency, which may hold significance in situations where interpretability and computational efficiency are prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Insights:** We have categorised the customers into these two segments because we can market different type of campaigns to each category of guests. For example, for amenity users (heavy spenders), we can give promotional offers on dinners or spa or maybe we can pitch an all inclusive offer for them to increase customer footfall of this category. For other users, we can offer them discounts on stay only or maybe provide a upgrade to a higher category room on a discounted fare. "
